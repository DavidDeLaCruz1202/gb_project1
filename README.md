# gb_project1
A project I created to practice using git bash on Windows

## Topics covered
1) Creating directory (`mkdir`)
2) Cloning github repo, setting up credentials
3) Adding, committing, and pushing
4) Reverting changes / commit (removed `trash.txt` file that was pushed)
5) Creating a new branch (`development`)
6) Switching to branch and creating new file through VS Code
7) Pushing to that branch
8) Merging branch with `main` branch

## Afterthoughts
I've used git bash before on Windows but never really knew what I was doing, but after learning more about Git and using Github Desktop for a while as a way to easily see what was going on, I feel that I understand using git through the traditional way (with terminal) much more than I ever did. Getting stronger!
